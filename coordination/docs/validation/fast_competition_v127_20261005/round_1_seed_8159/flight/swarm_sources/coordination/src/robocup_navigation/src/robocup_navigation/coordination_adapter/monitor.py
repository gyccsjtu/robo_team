"""Independent physical monitor for multi-UAV runs.

Interface v0 §4: the coordinator's own authorisation events *cannot* prove
physical safety, so collision / separation / arrival measurements must come
from an independent source that covers the whole run (landing included) and
produces the ``monitor_report`` the core only aggregates.

This class is deliberately not fed by the core.  On the development harness the
values may come from Gazebo truth / TF; that data must never be routed into the
core (the core must not read truth).

collision_count / min_separation / max_arrival_error / max_no_progress are the
exact fields RUN_FINISHED.monitor_report expects.
