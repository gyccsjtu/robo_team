# Semantics
# ---------
# - A sliding square window in the ENU ``map`` frame, centred near the drone,
#   snapped to the resolution so the origin only moves in whole-cell steps.
# - Cell states are tracked exactly; ``to_grid_map`` folds them into the
#   A* ``GridMap`` convention (0 = free, 1 = blocked).  UNKNOWN cells fold to
#   blocked when ``unknown_is_obstacle`` is set, which is the perception-mode
#   default: the drone never plans through space it has not observed.
# - Depth hits below the obstacle band (ground returns) mark their cell FREE:
#   the ray passed through that column below the band without hitting anything.
# - Hits inside the band mark their cell OCCUPIED.
# - Hits above the band and out-of-range pixels leave cells UNKNOWN.
