"""Transport-independent plumbing around the Codex coordination core.

Deliberately free of rospy so the integration logic is host-testable without a
running ROS graph; ``node.py`` is the thin ROS wrapper over this module.

Two contracts from interface v0 are enforced here and must not be "optimised":

  * Single writer.  ``Coordinator`` is a single-writer state machine; every
    input goes through :meth:`CoreBus.submit` from ONE thread.
  * Full-stream fan-out.  Interface v0 (executor handshake #2): each
    :class:`ExecutorGate` must receive the COMPLETE coordinator output stream,
    including messages addressed to *other* UAVs.  Filtering per UAV before the
    gate makes its sequence check reject a gap.
